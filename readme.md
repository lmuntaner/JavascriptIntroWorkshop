# Javascript Ninja! Beginner Level

- This is a project to help learn javascript for beginners
- It gives them some funcitons that create questions
- These questions are launched when the "Start Quiz" button is clicked
- They also need to write the setAndPrintScore that will be called given all the answers
- They must go from one answer to the next one checking if the answer is correct
- Using ifs or one loop and one if. The are plenty of ways.
- At the end they need to call one last function that will display the score

No callbacks, no scope issues, nothing advanced at all.
I attached to ```window``` the functions that they need.
